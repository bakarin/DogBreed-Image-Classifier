# DogBreed-Image-Classifier
In these notebooks we build convolutional neural networks with TensorFlow/Keras. One notebook does it from "scratch" and the other utilizes Transfer Learning with the pretrained Xception network.

The dataset, called ![ImageWoof](https://github.com/fastai/imagenette), is a subset of dog pictures from ImageNet and consists of 10.000 training and 3000 test data. It contains the dog breeds Australian Terrier, Border Terrier, Samoyed, Beagle, Shih-Tzu, English Foxhound, Rhodesian Ridgeback, Dingo, Golden Retriever and Old English Sheepdog.
